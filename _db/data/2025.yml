My sons were both confused about what I was taking a photo of and why I was smiling. I'm curious about what language they use to power these screens.

With its characterful old buildings, a choice of welcoming pubs (all within a short stroll of a brilliant children’s play area), and winding paths perfect for a dog like Ozzie to explore, it really is a place that keeps everyone happy — grown-ups, little ones, and four-legged friends alike.<br ><br >Set high on a breezy hilltop, Brill offers more than just pretty views. Once a royal hunting lodge, the village carries centuries of history — most famously marked by its beautifully preserved 17th-century windmill, standing watch over the rolling hills of the Chilterns."

We went to the Power Up exhibition in the Science Museum which had interactive displays spanning back to the dawn of time (Pong) through to the present day. This is the Amiga 500 - the first computer I owned and (along with the A1200) still the machine I love the most.<br ><br >You can see <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/albums/72177720324876255/\">all my pictures in this album</a>, although you may have seen this exhibition elsewhere on this site...<br ><br >I went along with the fine folk of my online gaming group. I have spoken to these people pretty much every day for over a decade and yet I think it's perhaps the second time we've been together in person.<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/54431768766/\">Flickr</a>."

    description: "We visited Liverpool for 3 days in May. Richard has never visited (when I ask Brits if they have been to Liverpool they get a strange look in their eyes implying “what would be the point”) so having visited last August with my sister and cousin I included Liverpool on a recent road trip. He spent the first 2 hours staring and saying “I didn’t know it would be like this”.  We booked a history walking tour one morning and at the Beatles Statue on the docks our guide told us to look very carefully at each Beatle to discover a secret symbol. Paul was obvious - a camera to honour Linda. George’s jacket sash in the back is in Sanskrit (we don’t know what it says). John is holding 2 acorns - he and Yoko planted 2 acorns in Central Park (apparently stolen). The acorns represent peace between nations. Ringo’s was on the heel of one of his boots - it’s the postcode of where he grew up - L8.  We thought it was brilliant. Go visit Liverpool!"

Mini-mudder 1.5 km or 3 km course for kids.\r\n2. 5 km course for adults.\r\n3. 15 km course for insane adults.<br ><br >My kids did the 1.5 km course over obstacles and through the woods, while Claire and her works team completed the 5 km course. To say it was hard is an understatement! The 5 km course took them over 5 hours! And from what I gather, most of the obstacles were impossible to complete without the help of your teammates. What made it even worse was it just so happened to be the hottest day of the year up to that point! I was knackered just following my kids around the 1.5 km course! No chance I'd ever try it myself!<br ><br >But if you like punishment and fancy a fun day out, they are held quite regularly all over the country. So give it a try and raise some money for the charity of your choice."

Regarding the windmill - at one time there were 3,000 on Öland. Now just a few. This one is in need of repair but we found it charming with an atmospheric brooding sky in the background that morning. Richard caught the image well. By the way, we learned that Frida had a ticket on the Titanic in 1912. She was leaving with a friend but her friend was late and they missed the boat!

Relief scenes set into the base showed Picton’s attack on Badajoz and his death.\r\nThe monument had become unsafe by 1846 and unfashionable so was then demolished and replaced by the present obelisk. It must have been an impressive sight."

The Monument was designed by John Nash and made by E.H. Baily in 1827. It stood 23m tall and was replaced by the present obelisk in 1846 as it was then unsafe and unfashionable.

    caption: "New House, new curtain"
    description: "As mentioned last month, we have been going through a house move recently. Our dog Ozzie was totally beside himself at first, crying and howling at night, didn't want to be left alone. Thankfully, he is over this now and is fairly well settled. We can tell this is the case because he has found a replacement curtain to lie under. <br ><br >As you can see in the photo, this is what he tends to look like when getting out from under the curtain. We have so many photos of him like this we are contemplating creating a photo calendar of \"Ozzie under a curtain\" for 2026!"

The puffins, artic terns and ‘jumplings’ (Guillemot chicks) were particularly entertaining. We  enjoyed the coastal walking, numerous castles and gardens too."

My sons were both confused about what I was taking a photo of and why I was smiling. I'm curious about what language they use to power these screens.

Once a royal hunting lodge, the village carries centuries of history — most famously marked by its beautifully preserved 17th-century windmill, standing watch over the rolling hills of the Chilterns."

I have spoken to these people pretty much every day for over a decade and yet I think it's perhaps the second time we've been together in person.<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/54431768766/\">Flickr</a>."

    description: "We visited Liverpool for 3 days in May. Richard has never visited (when I ask Brits if they have been to Liverpool they get a strange look in their eyes implying “what would be the point”) so having visited last August with my sister and cousin I included Liverpool on a recent road trip. He spent the first 2 hours staring and saying “I didn’t know it would be like this”.  We booked a history walking tour one morning and at the Beatles Statue on the docks our guide told us to look very carefully at each Beatle to discover a secret symbol. Paul was obvious - a camera to honour Linda. George’s jacket sash in the back is in Sanskrit (we don’t know what it says). John is holding 2 acorns - he and Yoko planted 2 acorns in Central Park (apparently stolen). The acorns represent peace between nations. Ringo’s was on the heel of one of his boots - it’s the postcode of where he grew up - L8.  We thought it was brilliant. Go visit Liverpool!"

Mini-mudder 1.5 km or 3 km course for kids.\r\n2. 5 km course for adults.\r\n3. 15 km course for insane adults.<br ><br >My kids did the 1.5 km course over obstacles and through the woods, while Claire and her works team completed the 5 km course. To say it was hard is an understatement! The 5 km course took them over 5 hours! And from what I gather, most of the obstacles were impossible to complete without the help of your teammates. What made it even worse was it just so happened to be the hottest day of the year up to that point! I was knackered just following my kids around the 1.5 km course! No chance I'd ever try it myself!<br ><br >But if you like punishment and fancy a fun day out, they are held quite regularly all over the country. So give it a try and raise some money for the charity of your choice."

Regarding the windmill - at one time there were 3,000 on Öland. Now just a few. This one is in need of repair but we found it charming with an atmospheric brooding sky in the background that morning. Richard caught the image well. By the way, we learned that Frida had a ticket on the Titanic in 1912. She was leaving with a friend but her friend was late and they missed the boat!

Relief scenes set into the base showed Picton’s attack on Badajoz and his death.\r\nThe monument had become unsafe by 1846 and unfashionable so was then demolished and replaced by the present obelisk. It must have been an impressive sight."

The Monument was designed by John Nash and made by E.H. Baily in 1827. It stood 23m tall and was replaced by the present obelisk in 1846 as it was then unsafe and unfashionable.

Our dog Ozzie was totally beside himself at first, crying and howling at night, didn't want to be left alone. Thankfully, he is over this now and is fairly well settled. We can tell this is the case because he has found a replacement curtain to lie under. <br ><br >As you can see in the photo, this is what he tends to look like when getting out from under the curtain. We have so many photos of him like this we are contemplating creating a photo calendar of \"Ozzie under a curtain\" for 2026!"

    alt: "A collage of textures portraying a) two very long alien snake-like cucumbers hanging through an iron archway covered in a fruit which looks like cherries. Next to this is a picture of some grey pelt lichen which thickly covered a tree stump with crusty ovals edges with coarse hair-like filaments. Fascinating!  Below this is a fungi structure called ‘Chicken of The Woods’, emerging from a large hole in a tree. It is egg yolk yellow and is formed in layers with dense cream pores on the undersides. The final picture next to this shows part of a very pretty floral display at our local church for VJ Day at the Flower Festival held there. It had red and white flowers interspersed with blue glass birds and was backed by a Union Jack Flag. Best in show, well done Clive!"

There are so many different methods, styles, patterns, and approaches, and most of the time you never know exactly what you're going to get in the end! Each is a mini work of art. I managed to find a supplier who sold me a bit of a job lot of seconds discs for cheap, and we have been having fun as a family creating our custom pieces."

I gave it a turquoise hue which made it even more spooky. 2) A collection of mustard coloured oak leaves and acorns naturally lying in an arty formation but no squirrels anywhere to be seen!! 3) a collection of black Fungi called Elfin’s Saddle surprisingly lying almost unnoticeable at the base of a tree next to a boardwalk through an old part of the woods on a large estate. In the early stage they look just like golfball size black lumps which develop on a greyish stem about three inches high displaying a black saddle shape sitting on top. Not very common. A great find for a Fungi fiend! 4) A fallen thinnish light golden branch peeled of its bark, looking much like a large Stick Insect walking up a bracken bank in the woods.

    description: "I learned to play Free Cell on the old family desktop computer in the 90s, back when the internet was by dialup and you had to check no one needed the phone first.  Or maybe it was a little after that?  Maybe it was when the splitter gadjet came in... In any case, there were definitely no laptops in the household, and just the one desktop. Once I'd learned the rules of the game, I switched to playing with a pack of cards, which I could take anywhere and play any time.  The advantage of the PC version was that if I messed up really badly I could restart the same game and try again.  These days, my 2023 laptop doesn't have Free Cell on it, whereas I still have cards... And actually, I think I prefer the ritual of dealing them out and pondering on their real life faces."

    description: "As an American, I’ve always celebrated thanksgiving. It’s just a good idea to stop once a year and think about what you are thankful for, whether or not you mark the occasion with a turkey. This year I am thankful for the traditional choices of friends and family and health - but this year also marks our return to Liverpool as a hometown and our move toward retirement here. I woke up thanksgiving morning in London and took an early train back to be greeted by Liverpool on my return."

This is where the water should be escaping, but instead... well. Under all this somewhere is a drain. Guess why it isn't working properly?<br ><br >Hours of climbing and cleaning emptied the gutter. Then removing the 25kg silt resulted in an explosion of muck in my flat and another 7-8 hours of scrubbing to remove most of the black horror before ANOTHER 3 hours of work by a processional carpet cleaner finally brought things back to more or less normal. This was a miserable weekend.<br ><br >On the upside, it doesn't seem to be raining indoors any more.<br ><br >All the pictures are in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/albums/72177720330467361/\">this Flickr album</a>.<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/54937577217/\">Flickr</a>."

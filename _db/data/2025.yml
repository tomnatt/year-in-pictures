My sons were both confused about what I was taking a photo of and why I was smiling. I'm curious about what language they use to power these screens.

    description: "Our Antartica, South Georgia & Falklands trip continued into March. In addition to 67 bird species we saw many whale, dolphin and seal species. Humpback whales outnumbered the others and I was blessed to see this one ‘fluking’ close-up whilst travelling on a small RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat)."

    description: "A friend has commissioned me to carve a dragon. To practise I've made a few of these hatchlings. This one, with it's foot emerging, is in oak. The first and last in that hardwood. I've had a frozen shoulder from being hunched over working on this one. Dragons, even hatchlings it seems, are dangerous beasts!"

    description: "Happy \"Adult Crafting Day\" (aka World Book Day) everyone! The boy wanted to go as Will Parry from The Subtle Knife (the His Dark Materials series). \"That's fine,\" I said: \"a bloody rag to be for the two fingers he lost, and we'll make a quick knife.\" I then spent four hours making said knife! Turned out pretty well though, and he was super happy with it.<br ><br >The knife is made from XPS foam (a type of insulation board) cut to shape with a hot wire and a knife, sealed with mod podge (a PVA-based sealant) mixed with black paint, then painted layered up / highlighted / washed for shadows. I had great fun making it!<br ><br >I was fully expecting it to be trashed by the time it came home, and I wasn't wrong (the blade had snapped off the hilt). But it's been repaired and strengthened, and still works!"

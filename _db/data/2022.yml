    description: "I don't think I've ever walked so much in January!  The resolution to walk more came on the back of a Christmas shopping trip in late December.  I discovered, to my horror, that after weeks of resting my Achilles tendons, my whole body had weakened and walking felt like an effort!  So I resolved to walk as often as possible (and take up daily pilates).  The result of all this, besides improved strength and wellbeing, is a rather large collection of winter sunset pictures.  Which for me is a new thing, I normally hunker down inside in the winter months.  This picture shows a phenomenon that probably most outdoorsy people have seen often but for me was new: horizontal stripes of blue, then pink, fading back to blue.  I saw a lot of that in January on clear days and I guess it must be a winter thing?  Or maybe a January thing?  I'm fairly sure I haven't seen these particular shades of pink and blue in summer and I was so glad to witness it, it was magical."

    description: "It's been about 9 months since I first setup the tropical aquarium my family bought me for Father's Day 2021, and quite a lot has changed in the last three-quarters-of-a-year.<br ><br >After initially setting up the tank with an impressive bubble bar, which created a lovely curtain of silvery movement, I later found out this over-oxygenation was likely the cause of my plants quickly dying. So that came out and a lot more plants went in (to keep the water's oxygen levels high).<br ><br >With an influx of new plants came a new problem: so-called \"pest snails.\" These things likely came in as eggs laid on the leaves of the new plants, which are hard to spot. They're even more difficult to get rid of once the snails themselves get a foothold. The natural solution? Fight snails with snails - specifically \"assassin snails\" - which set about digging up and eating any and all newly-laid pest snail eggs. Meanwhile I regularly fished out any grown pest snails with a small net, and sent them to the Land of Loo.<br ><br >It took 3 attempts to establish a stable Taiwan cherry shrimp colony--and by \"stable\" I mean they now reproduce like rabbits. Their high numbers don't seem to be a problem for the ecological balance of the tank though.<br ><br >Sadly, as seems to be increasingly common, my cardinal tetras all seem to have come bearing \"tetra disease\" - a highly varied spectrum of symptoms that cause different mutations and ultimately kill the individual fish. I've suddenly lost 4 of the original 7 in the last few weeks alone, which has been difficult to watch - especially when the cherry shrimp get involved in cleaning up. They don't thrive in groups under 6 in number though, so the remaining 3 will be under increased stress with fewer tank-mates. This will need remedying quickly if the remainder are going to stay (relatively) healthy.<br ><br >Which leads me to Haku, my mischievous and often-sassy blue Betta. Whilst he remains active and curious, I've noticed significant deterioration in his dorsal fin over the last couple of months. Bettas commonly suffer from a nasty illness called \"fin rot,\" which is a fungal infection that eats away the delicate tissues of their fins. Particularly bad infections can even attack their bodies, causing serious illness and death. I'm not sure this is what Haku is suffering from, but the tank has been dosed with a natural anti-fungal mixture for the past week just to be sure.<br ><br >I've been changing at least 25% of the tank's water every week now for many months already, treating it with tap water neutraliser each time, so I'm hoping it's not a dirty or dangerous environment that's caused the deterioration of Haku's fin. I think this means that water condition is the next thing to get more of an accurate understanding of though, as sticking with guesswork is likely just going to kill more fish."

Since then, we've had our small person, and my Mum has moved in with her two cats, and both my wife and I are working from home more often than not. More space (and another toilet!) required...<br ><br >We love our town, and the fact that our back gate opens straight into a small nature reserve, so we didn't want to move. Thankfully we had a garage (which has never had a car in it) and space in front of that at the side of the house, so we decided to extend into that space. It's taken well over a year, but this month the work actually started! Hopefully in a couple more months, we'll have most of it all done, inside and out, and we can start enjoying swinging those cats."

It was lovely to see everyone and I took a few pictures of some of the things that stood out to me: the sun preparing to dip behind the mountain; a wall of scent; a beautiful bougainvillea; and the acropolis by night (sorry its blurry).\r\nThere were of course other moments I have no picture for, like the sensation of sand under my bare feet.  I'd forgotten how good that feels!  And the lovely sound of waves.  It was a good holiday :)"

We had to tell Richard eventually though so it wasn’t a complete surprise.  Richard is a former IT director so you would have thought this would never be a “nagging” situation. It was built in about 10 hours and the result has been super. It is quite wonderful when the son teaches the father something!"

    description: "The Fairford Air Tattoo is the largest military air show in the world.  In years past, we’ve watched many of the planes fly over our house so decided we should take the plunge and attend but Covid delayed us for 2 years.  It was a hot and sunny day. The crowds were huge (understatement). They arrived with tents, umbrellas, coolers, kids, dogs and planted themselves in the fields. We had tickets in the stands thankfully.  It was loud and long and to be honest quite repetitive. There are only so many manoeuvres a helicopter can do. The most interesting displays were the aerobatic ones - Red Arrrows, Koreans, Italians, Jordanians. The air show was constantly running but when you needed a break you could go view the standing displays which included planes from all over the world.  Many people know where to view the show from the local area without entering the airbase. We just need to find out where those areas are for the future. It was difficult to choose a photo this month as we visited beautiful Tresco in the Isles of Scilly as well. The Koreans won out as you can see in the photo. We hope you are all well."

We stayed near St Austell and visited Eden, Charlestown, Mevagissey, The Lost Gardens of Heligan and Kings Wood. I took loads of photos! But these two are my faves purely for the delight at unexpectedly discovering a random door and door number in a tree in Kings Wood; and the equal delight at discovering there was a fairy theme at the Lost Gardens! There were fairy sculptures dotted about and I got pictures of several before the heavens opened and we left to find shelter from the rain. I'd love to go back and find the rest of them! :D"

This was done as a deterrent to his fellow countrymen from joining in Owain’s guerilla warfare against Henry. Despite this the campaign continued for another 14 years but the Prince was never captured.\r\nThe statue was erected in 2001 and was made of stainless steel by Welsh sculptor David Petersen’s two sons. \r\nWhat a story - a true braveheart!"

We loved the structure and it’s bright colourful contrast with the wall and fort. It makes you realise how big the fort was originally, with 4 gatehouses all just as big as the art installation and corner towers too. A brilliant idea and visit."

The Sitges Mermaid is one of the most emblematic sculptures. It was created in bronze by artist Pere Jou in 1964, and is located on the stairs of La Punta, in front of the Church of San Bartolomé and Santa Tecla. Her open palm encourages people to hold their hand against it; the wear on other parts of the body shows that others have chosen a different location to place their hands."

We've never kept an insect as a pet before, and he is already surprising and delighting us with his suddent bursts of speed and very inquisitive nature.<br ><br >We're looking forward to watching him grow and change colour as he matures.

The sunset was spectacular, so we quickly found a place to park and I took a few pics of it. Sadly, I missed the most spectacular place.

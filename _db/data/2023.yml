    description: "I really like the look of this old printing-press typewriter thingy that we stumbled across in a random dusty barn, but I can't exactly put my finger on why. This feels slightly ironic, given what this device would have been used for back in its hay-day. Yet, the fact that I can't describe something as menial as a bit of \"vibey\" junk is no surprise really at the moment. It feels hard to put my finger on lots of things. How am I feeling? How has my week been? These used to feel like easier questions to answer. Maybe I'm less attentive. Maybe my ability to utilise adjectives has been seriously depleted by the numbing nature of Netflix. What I can tell you is that I slept the night through for the first time in months last night and I cannot put into words how amazing that feels."

We’ve never seen a Gurney Stove in any Abbey or church. According to the information sign, these stoves were made by the London Warming and Ventilating Company in the 19th century. They used anthracite (burns cleaner and more efficient than regular coal) which was claimed to be a cheap source of heat. They are now gas fired. The photo doesn’t convey the size - quite large.  Tewksbury is a bit tired.  There are 376 listed buildings and little alleyways to explore as well as an interesting Riverside Walk and Battle Trail. Well worth a visit. Hope you are all keeping well."

The ones we met were generally very relaxed, being used to human contact, but also quite vocal and inquisitive too. They also have distinct, individual personalities, which makes them fascinating to watch as they each behave differently and interact with you and each other in their own way.<br ><br >We really enjoyed getting to spend time in amongst them and also being able to walk a couple of them around a few acres of paddock.

They hadn’t experienced being on a canal boat. We all had a turn at steering although Captain Richard did most of the navigating. The crew did the locks. We needed Tony to stand on the end of one gate in order for it to open while Jackie and I pushed. We had sun and showers so we were lucky as it was the unsettled weather part of May.

The tour was fascinating as they still broadcast and were doing so while we had the tour. In retrospect, we realised just how much the pirate ships changed the British music culture. The ship is now a rust bucket and now needs to go into dry dock for restoration. We hope enough money can be donated for this purpose."

    description: "Why are some of the most serene moments found in places that have a contentious history steeped with darkness? I loved this little walk with my family in blustery Northern Ireland at the turn of the new year. Yet, I also have this nagging sense of guilt surrounding the slave trade, the violence and the imperialism that has led to the space being set aside and protected that I might be able to enjoy it."

Huge Christmas market and numerous food stalls. This was my favourite part. Once it went dark, they started projecting onto the Manor. A still image doesn't do all the animation's justice, but this was a depiction of a huge advent calendar, with opening and closing doors. I highly recommend Waddesdon if you are in the area."

    description: "Just off the Fosse Way, near Northleach, is this lovely avenue of trees. I've tried, in many Autumns, to capture the colours. This time the leaves had mostly gone but the frost was still there as I was on my way to a Craft Fayre in Northleach. It had been foggy in Cirencester but the sky cleared so I just had to stop. I only had my phone but it did the job."
    alt: "A simple image with a road (no white lines) in the centre leading off into the distance. The road is lined on both sides by frost-lined trees with blue sky peeking through their bare branches.  Outside the trees, on each side are low Cotswold stone walls and fields beyond those. Were the ground is visible that is also lined with frost, apart from the solid black of the road itself."

Hats off to the owner of Ski with Ease ski and board school for the green intentions."

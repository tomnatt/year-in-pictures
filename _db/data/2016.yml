    description: "Far from the best photo I have taken this month, but it's not every day someone unearths a 500lb World War 2 bomb less than 300m from your home. Thankfully. The entire area was evacuated while the bomb disposal folk from the army did their thing and I hid in the cinema, watching the explosions in Civil War and expecting them to be done by the time Captain America had finished punching Iron Man. Unfortunately, due to complications caused by the bomb getting bashed up when falling from an aircraft and landing in an awkward way they spent the next 24 hours building a sand castle around it before sticking it on a truck and giving it a tour of Bath on the way to final disposal somewhere more expendable. I am fortunate to have good friends who don't mind being interrupted in the middle of the night and have a sofa bed, so I managed to avoid the temporary refugee camp set up for the newly-homeless.<br >
    <br >
    Things I learned, should I ever have to evacuate part of a city while some German engineering is removed:
    <ul>
    <li>issue the full evacuation notice before people would normally go to bed - midnight is not a good time for people to start phoning their friends to call in favours</li>
    <li>instruct the police on the cordon to provide more information than \"they've found a bomb\"...</li>

    description: "Another trip to the Minch bonfire party and an evening spent gazing into flames and considering the future. This year the weather was dry so the fire burnt quickly and all my photos were towards the end of its life. I like this one - the fire looks alive, it is framed reasonably well and there are the ghosts of the Minch volunteers lurking in the background.

    caption: "The Purton Hulks..."
    description: "No, not my Father, but a large number of abandoned boats and ships which were deliberately beached beside the River Severn near Purton in Gloucestershire. In 1909 there were concerns that the barrier between the Severn and the Sharpness Canal (only yards apart) would be breached. To reinforce the river banks, a call went out to run aground old vessels and these soon filled with water and silt to create a tidal erosion barrier. Many were beached up to as late as 1974 and are now in a state of considerable decay. Some 65 vessels have been identified and the site forms the largest ship graveyard in mainland Britain."

    description: "On one of those crisp Christmas winter walks, with a clear blue sky yet very cold, we arrived at this Windmill in a field. It's been there since around 1650 and is now dormant and only open a few days a year. Here's to 2017!"

    caption: "Station 466 Membury"
    description: "Goodness knows how many times I've stopped at Membury services over the years, but only this month did I spot this memorial overlooking the westbound car park. It is made from an aircraft propeller and is dedicated to the members of the RAF and USAAF who served at Station 466 Membury from 1941-47. The whole area was an airfield which, after the war, was turned into a private airport before being closed to make way for the M4 - although the runways are still tucked behind the services and used by visiting pilots at weekends.<br><br>Apparently this monument has been there since 1994. In my defence, I tend to stop at Membury when going east."

    description: "Every year at Christmas, Bognor cinema gets out it's model village. You walk past the village into the theatre and watch whatever comes before the film, usually adverts but if you are lucky it could be a bonus animation. Then the curtain comes down and opens on a picture of a horse drawn carriage in the snow and a message from the cinema wishing everyone Merry Christmas! Then there is a film."

    description: "Isn't it embarrassing when someone turns up to the party wearing your carefully selected outfit? This, presumably, is the only explanation for the expression being worn by half the featured artists in this photo. Either that, or having had 6 weeks to absorb the marvel of 2016, young Alex is not liking the look of 2017. Indeed, it seems that Leicester City will have to content themselves with an FA Cup/Champions League double this year. Tough times for a wee man..."

    caption: "Into the mists"
    description: "Fairly representative of the view during December. Christmas was spent on the edge of a village common, entirely shrouded in thick mists. It was a beautiful sight, with the trees looming out at you and the occasional horse suddenly appearing, looking for its donkey friend. Something of metaphor of our walk into 2017 - peering ahead and not being able to see what is going to emerge from the murk of 2016. Here's to horses in 2017.<br><br>That would have made more sense if 2017 was the year of the horse.<br><br>From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/31481312263/\">Flickr</a>."

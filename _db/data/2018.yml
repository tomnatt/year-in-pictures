The Snowdrops are here, but also Daffodil bulbs are sprouting forth, with some hints from the Tulips just poking through the soil, and here and there some germinated seeds of various coloured Poppies are giving promise of a colourful ride through to summer. But the leftovers of winter are still evident elsewhere in the garden, with lots of branches broken by the weight of snow now waiting to be cut back and cleared away to the refuse tip. A garden never sleeps..."

The one behind the motley crew is imaginatively called Steel Bridge because .... well you can probably work out why! Built in 1905 it carries local trams, trains, vehicles and pedestrians. The middle section rises between the towers to allow shipping to pass through. Overall, it's quite a bit of Meccano."

Athens is pretty much surrounded by mountains!).  It really gives you a feel for the huge size of the capital, although admittedly only a fraction of the size of London (just for perspective).  Anyways, I love a good vantage point, especially if it involves a mountain.  Extra bonus if there are more than one!  :D"

There was only one for many years but now more have arrived. I once saw him wrestle an eel which wrapped itself around his neck as he tried to swallow it. The cormorant won. They can stay under water for so long you assume they've surfaced elsewhere and stop looking, then it pops up right next to you with a fish in it's beak."

    description: "I was choreographing a song with three different tunes/themes that repeat with little variations.  I had ideas of what I wanted to do for each theme and variation but kept loosing track of which order they appeared and how many times they repeat and with which variations each time (brain like a sieve these days).  So I concluded that I needed a visual map of the entire song.  I decided to name the musical  themes and write the names down in the order they appeared... but then needed a memory jogger as to which name was which theme (like I say... memory... sieve).  So how do you write down music without actually writing down music?  Squiggles.  A friend commented that were someone to find my notebook in 1000 odd years time they might wonder what language it was :D   That made me laugh so here it is, to hopefully amuse you too!"

The shore was eroding fast and to protect the seafront houses, big boulders were put in place; but nature had a better plan. One stormy night the power of the sea opened up the spit and the water started to flow straight out of the harbour into the sea. Gradually the old channel got blocked off and the seafront houses have now a lagoon in front of them and the sea in the distance."

After the fall of communism, the fountain fell into disrepair and since 2007 it has been out of order. Restoration would cost an estimated €1,000,000 so, unsurprisingly, the plans for a new Freedom Square don't feature the flower at all."

    description: "Overlooking one of the lakes at our favourite nature reserve recently on a very cold wintry day we wondered where the geese and ducks were hiding. There were some hugging the distant reed beds but not much around that day apart from a couple of herons, mind you it was a very chilly 4 degrees!!! I was looking forward to a nice shot of dark rum and blackcurrant but even the pub was closed!☹️"
    alt: "A wintry lake surrounded by reed beds, but it was so cold even wildlife weren’t venturing out that day. The sun did not break through the clouds but a glimmer was reflected in the water and the high clouds looked like wispy threads. Even the pub shut early so I missed my rum and blackcurrant!☹️"

I find it a really interesting technical challenge, and also I love firework displays and staring into bonfires. You can see all of my pictures <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/sets/72157703211335564\">in this album on Flickr</a>.<br ><br >This particular picture is, I think, my favourite. The fire looks almost liquid and on the right is a door showing why you close doors during a fire - they are indestructible.

    description: "We met some friends at The Vineyard outside of Newbury for a coffee this month before a lunch at another venue.  We were amazed to discover this huge mural in their tasting room depicting the scene in 1976 at a blind wine tasting in France between French and California wines. The Americans won both the red and white tasting to the shock of the French. We have seen one of the winning bottles at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington. This contest ended the myth of French wine supremacy and made way for the introduction and acceptance of New World wines. The movie Bottle Shock tells the story and is well worth a viewing."

    description: "First signs of new growth in the garden always makes me want Spring to hurry up and arrive. The Snowdrops are here, but also Daffodil bulbs are sprouting forth, with some hints from the Tulips just poking through the soil, and here and there some germinated seeds of various coloured Poppies are giving promise of a colourful ride through to summer. But the leftovers of winter are still evident elsewhere in the garden, with lots of branches broken by the weight of snow now waiting to be cut back and cleared away to the refuse tip. A garden never sleeps..."

The one behind the motley crew is imaginatively called Steel Bridge because .... well you can probably work out why! Built in 1905 it carries local trams, trains, vehicles and pedestrians. The middle section rises between the towers to allow shipping to pass through. Overall, it's quite a bit of Meccano."

Athens is pretty much surrounded by mountains!).  It really gives you a feel for the huge size of the capital, although admittedly only a fraction of the size of London (just for perspective).  Anyways, I love a good vantage point, especially if it involves a mountain.  Extra bonus if there are more than one!  :D"

They can stay under water for so long you assume they've surfaced elsewhere and stop looking, then it pops up right next to you with a fish in it's beak."

So how do you write down music without actually writing down music?  Squiggles.

    description: "This little stretch of water was not so long ago a raging torrent, as it formed a narrow channel in and out of Pagham Harbour. The shore was eroding fast and to protect the seafront houses, big boulders were put in place; but nature had a better plan. One stormy night the power of the sea opened up the spit and the water started to flow straight out of the harbour into the sea. Gradually the old channel got blocked off and the seafront houses have now a lagoon in front of them and the sea in the distance."

    description: "This impressive Cathedral in the grounds of Wawel castle dates primarily from the 14th Century. It is one of many very well preserved old buildings in Krakow's beautiful Old Town. Seeing it at dusk, with the warm glow of the evening sun on it, was very special and took away the edge of the freezing temperatures."

    description: "The replica of 'The Matthew' moored at Wapping Wharf in Bristol on a mild December day. She was a caravelle ship captained by John Cabot in 1497 when she left Bristol for North America, presumably Newfoundland. She only weighed 50 tons and was fast and able. A beauty but hard to imagine crossing the Atlantic in such a small and fragile looking vessel!"

I suspect the existence of these has been kept a secret because SOMEONE was worried they would lose. To be fair, they were right. Very, very right.<br ><br >Still - a very welcome discovery. And now the year is over and we look forward to 2019. Happy New Year everyone!<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/31663571637/\">Flickr</a>."

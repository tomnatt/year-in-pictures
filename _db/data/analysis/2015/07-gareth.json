  "description": "The image shows a cluttered desk with several papers and a soda can. The papers appear to be scripts or documents related to a production, as indicated by the visible text such as 'BULL - Episode 1' and 'John Stanley Productions'. There is a notable coffee stain and handwritten notes, suggesting active use and review. The setting seems informal and possibly creative, like a workspace or a writer's desk.",

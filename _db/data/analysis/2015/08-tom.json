  "description": "The image captures a vibrant scene inside a large tent at a festival. A crowd of people, diverse in age and appearance, is gathered, watching a performance on a stage illuminated by blue lights. Many attendees are raising their hands in excitement, contributing to the lively atmosphere. The structure of the tent, with its metal supports and lighting fixtures, is clearly visible, enhancing the sense of a temporary yet significant event space designed for large gatherings and entertainment.",

  "description": "The image captures a dramatic night scene of a large bonfire, blazing intensely against the dark backdrop. The fire is built from a heap of wooden materials, creating a towering inferno that illuminates the surrounding area with a warm, orange glow. Sparks and embers are seen swirling in the air, adding a dynamic and somewhat magical element to the scene. In the foreground, silhouettes of people can be seen observing the fire, suggesting a communal or celebratory event. The setting appears to be a grassy outdoor area, possibly a park or rural field, under a clear night sky.",

  "poem": "A bonfire burns in the night so clear,\nWith sparks that dance and bring us cheer,\nPeople gather round to see,\nThe flames that leap so wild and free,\nIn this night, our spirits soar with glee."

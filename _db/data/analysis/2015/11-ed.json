  "description": "The image captures two monkeys sitting on a road, likely in a wildlife park. One monkey is grooming the other, picking at its fur, a common social behavior among primates. The background features a lush green landscape with trees and a few scattered structures, suggesting a rural or park setting. The viewpoint suggests the photo was taken from inside a vehicle, adding a layer of safe observation for the viewer.",

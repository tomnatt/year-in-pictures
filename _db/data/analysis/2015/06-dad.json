The top dial is a barometer, labeled with pressure measurements in hectopascals and weather condition icons. The middle dial is a thermometer, indicating temperature in degrees Celsius. The bottom dial is a hygrometer, showing humidity levels in percentage. Each dial has a metallic rim and is set against a beige background with the label 'weathereye' at the bottom.",

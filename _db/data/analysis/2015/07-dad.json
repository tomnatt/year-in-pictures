  "description": "This image captures a puffin sitting on a rocky and moss-covered ground, with rain gently falling around it. The puffin, with its distinctive black and white plumage and colorful beak, appears serene against the natural backdrop. The setting suggests a rugged coastal or island environment, typical of puffin habitats. The photograph has a sharp focus on the bird, highlighting its features and the wetness of its feathers, while the background remains softly blurred, emphasizing the puffin's presence in its natural surroundings.",

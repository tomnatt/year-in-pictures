  "description": "A group of seven men is gathered in a cozy living room for a game night. They are seated around a small wooden table cluttered with game pieces, dice, and cups, indicating an ongoing board game session. The room has a warm ambiance, enhanced by soft lighting and a traditional decor with a patterned carpet and floral curtains. One man stands, possibly narrating or taking his turn, while the others are seated, engaged in conversation or contemplation of their next move.",

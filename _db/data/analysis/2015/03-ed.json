  "description": "This image captures a serene underwater scene in an aquarium. The focus is on a vibrant yellow snail with a black shell, slowly moving across the sandy bottom. Surrounding the snail are various elements that enhance the aquatic ambiance: classical-style miniature columns that appear aged and mossy, a lush green plant, and a small striped fish swimming near the top. The overall setting is peaceful, with a hint of the mysterious, evoking a sense of calm observation of life under water.",

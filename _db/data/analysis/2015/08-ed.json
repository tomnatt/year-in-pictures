  "description": "This image features a creative birthday cake designed to resemble colorful LEGO bricks. The cake consists of three main pieces, each a different color: red, yellow, and blue. Additional small LEGO-like pieces are scattered around the main blocks. The cake is presented on a silver board with the greeting 'Happy Birthday Ed!' written in red icing, alongside the number '30' indicating the age being celebrated. The setting appears to be a kitchen counter, adding a cozy and informal atmosphere to the celebration.",

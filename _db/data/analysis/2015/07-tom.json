  "description": "The image depicts an empty classroom with a series of wooden tables arranged in a U-shape. The room has a tiled floor and light gray walls, with a green chalkboard on one wall and colorful accents around a window. Natural light streams in through barred windows, illuminating the space. The atmosphere appears calm and quiet, suggesting a space typically used for learning or meetings, currently awaiting its occupants.",

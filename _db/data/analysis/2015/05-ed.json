  "description": "This image depicts a detailed miniature model of a traditional English shopfront. The model features two distinct stores: 'Fruitereer & U.R.A. Peach Greengrocer' and 'Evan Leigh Soles,' a shoe shop. The greengrocer has a display window filled with neatly arranged miniature fruits and vegetables, while the shoe shop showcases various tiny shoes. The building itself is styled with classic black and white timber framing, and small, green-framed windows add to the quaint charm. The model is set against a cobblestone-like surface, enhancing its old-world feel.",

  "description": "The image shows a unique outdoor art installation in the form of a large, curved slide positioned over a body of water, likely a river or canal. The slide is supported by tall, dark pillars and has a metal handrail along its length. In the background, a classical building with multiple windows stretches across the scene, suggesting an urban setting. The sky is overcast, and the overall atmosphere is calm and slightly gloomy.",

  "poem": "A slide over water, quite the sight,\nIn the city's heart, under the light,\nCurved and tall, it stands with grace,\nOver the river, a playful place,\nA marvel in the urban space."

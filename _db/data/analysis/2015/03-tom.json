  "description": "The image depicts an unusual outdoor art installation in an urban setting, featuring two large, transparent inflatable bubbles. One bubble contains a cozy, makeshift bedroom with a purple bed, pillows, and small decorative items, suggesting an intimate, private space amidst the public area. The other bubble appears to be a bathroom setup with a white bathtub and towels, creating a stark contrast to the bustling city environment visible in the background. This installation draws the attention of passersby, blending elements of private living spaces with the public sphere.",

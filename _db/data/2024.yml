During our stay we all went to Bend for a few days and on our way back to Portland we visited this beautiful area of high dessert, called Smith Rock. Formed during 2 different volcanic episodes millions of years ago, it is now a hiker’s and climber’s paradise. The river is called The Crooked River and the park probably gets its name from John Smith, a county sheriff who is supposed to have discovered it in the mid 1800s. I expect indigenous peoples knew about it long before."

Thankfully, nobody was around, and the only victims were a low fence and the back window of a black Ford Focus! <br ><br >The local council came quickly to cut it into sections to unblock the thoroughfare through the woods - not that you'd want to walk through it at the moment! It's so muddy due to all the rain.<br ><br >As I wasn't there when it fell, I didn't finally get to answer the philosophical thought experiment: if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

Turns out that enough water got into the freezer to render it not-so-freezing, so that ended up being taken to the recycling centre, and all of the content went in the bin."

This is for any player from the match that has excelled above and beyond for football skill in the match. The prize is a big bag of Haribo sweets (Supermix this week). I'm more a tangtastic fan myself! But he was thrilled he'd been picked out for his excellent defending! <br ><br >The smaller bag of sweets was because it was one of his teammate's birthdays, so Haribo overload!"

    description: "In April, we went Mudlarking on the north foreshore of the Thames in London near the Millennium Bridge. This was a guided tour lead by a licensed guide as you now need a license to Mudlark. It was really fascinating to see what you could find washed up on the shore - from bits of clay pipes to Tudor or Medieval pottery.  We also found oyster shells from which buttons had been cut.  Mudlarking was a profession in times gone by when children would salvage coal or other supplies dropped from boats. Now it's become so popular that the activity has to be controlled as too much damage is being done to the foreshore. We were allowed to pick up objects but could not take them away. A memorable day and one we had looked forward to for some time."

An exhausting, emotional and fun week for us volunteering along with many others with the charity, Standing With Giants. You may have seen the BBC national news coverage and I’m sure there will be more as we get closer to the actual 80th Anniversary on 6th June. The finished installation, (this photo was taken just at the beginning stages) is spectacular and gives a real visual sense of how many people gave their lives for what we all have today, our freedom."

I've been fascinated by these events for years – and even made a documentary about the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00179yf\">1992 Ebbw Vale</a> festival.<br ><br >Managing the legacy of these festivals is notoriously difficult - especially as expectation and ambition as to what came next was always sky high - but they were only ever rolled-out in places where the economic circumstances were difficult to begin with. We found ourselves driving near the 1984 site and I had to make a detour to check it out. Just like Ebbw Vale, some of it has been turned over to housing, some is public woodland/parkland and a good portion is still under development – but walking round Festival Gardens is now a very peculiar experience. In amongst the drained lakes and rickety bridges you occasionally stumble upon partially restored remnants of the festival - like this pagoda."

We live on the edge of a flood plain, and it usually takes days or weeks of sustained wet weather for us to reach any level of real concern. This day, the water level went from \"what water?\" to \"that water's about to come in our house\" in just a few hours (and in fact did, via groundwater seeping in around the edges of the floor at a low-point). Thankfully it stopped (just) short, but did cause a lot of worry, and the sewers were back up and blocked for days..."

At one point, I noticed something in the water, slowly being pushed down the street. It turned out to be a lime. No idea where it came from, but I watched it be pushed a hundred metres or so down the street, until it got lodged in a drain.<br ><br >One the rain had been abated, we headed onto the beach to wander. There, I found what looked like a small nest shaped from the sand, containing two lemons and three limes, and scattered with small yellow sticks, which I can only assume had previously been used to form a small shelter or something similar.

    description: "Last January, I started running a fortnightly beginner-friendly D&D game for a bunch of people who didn't know each other (including me). It's the first time I've been part of an in-person game, and it's been great fun, but exploring the physical nature of the play, and just getting to know new people. We've had a couple of changes of personnel over the year, but mostly have had a stable group, and it's been great fun. In the last session before Christmas, the players gifted me a fantastic glass tankard engraved with \"Because I'm the Dungeon Master, that's why!\" I then proceeded to throw an acid river and will-o-wisps at them, and we'll be starting the first session of the new year straight into combat with a banshee! Why? See tankard."

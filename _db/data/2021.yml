    description: "I saw a woman use a glass orb last year so asked her about it and where she got it (Amazon - where else). So when trying to think of a Christmas present for Richard,  I remembered the orb.  He has a very expensive camera that is not being used as much as it could be as the phone is so easy, isn’t it. It’s been interesting and he is still working on technique. I held it once in my hand on a sunny day and within seconds my hand became really hot.  The speed was quite shocking.  Hope you are all keeping well. Life just feels a bit hollow at the moment but jabs for us oldies are hopefully coming soon."

They had been slit on their underbellies and some of the flesh had been removed. Researching, I discovered they are classified as small sharks. Unfortunately, dogfish have little commercial value, but are often caught by fisherman as by-catch. The flesh has to be removed as soon as they are caught, otherwise the skin leaks ammonia into the flesh. Apparently they used to be widely sold by fish & chip shops as Huss or Rock Salmon."

Difficult to take a camera out while we were in the lovely village of Painswick doing an illegal Treasure Trail. Then lots of grey, rainy days interspersed with cloudy days. However, the days are getting longer and we got our first jab which was really the highlight of the month. Near the end of the month, we were a bit shocked to have a sunny, windless and sort of warm evening.  It felt special.  So our photo choice is the lovely view by the fire pit. Hope you have all been enjoying the last few days of February sunshine and keeping well."

For me it's more just disconcerting to think of the very flimsy oneupmanship that must generally go on in marketing and how cheaply a word such as \"real\" can be applied.<br ><br >In all honesty, this nonsense waffle of mine is all talk. I purchased a jar and am making my way through it with a swagger, knowing I can saved £1.60 per jar whilst barely telling the difference between it and Hellmann's.

So what a surprise to come upon a huge blackthorn bush blooming in the Abbey Grounds in Cirencester on a dismal, cold Sunday. Looking closer we were delighted to see so many bees on the bush. However, as we have been having frosts everyday this week we are worried about their survival. Richard managed to get a closeup. By the time you see this photo we will all have a bit more freedom. Hopefully.  Enjoy."

He seems to be relishing the challenge... If I close my eyes I can see him go by, hooves pummelling the earth, dust flying, his voice projecting encouragement and direction. There is passion and energy in the image. Yes, the horses are pulling in different directions but he's in control, driving forwards from a place of exhilaration and enthusiasm.  What a great feeling!"

It was located in Kennington. We learned a lot, got to put on the nifty bee attire and were even allowed to hold the bee frame which seem to be missing the queen and had too many drones. The bee keeper thought things were a bit amiss in that hive. The Bee Experience also included a beer tasting (made with honey of course) along with some food which was a lovely way to end. London was a bit of a shock initially. We haven't seen so many young people in one place in over 18 months! It just felt so normal. A good feeling."

Nevertheless, I managed to find some great designs.  I love books and run a Book Group so the theme of books cheered me up quite a bit during this difficult time. It only took me 7 months to complete  (I hand quilted the top versus machine) and I spent many a happy evening watching lots of Netflix programmes sewing my quilt. My last quilt took 15 years!  Hope everyone is keeping well."

It was incredible seeing the detail and thought that went into the creation of this world.

    description: "The end of November marks a full 12 months of ownership of my mad little yellow bucket of crazy. At the risk of incurring the wrath of the mechanical gods, it's been absolutely faultless to own. It breezed through its first MOT and major service in my ownership and, even more remarkably, it's still sitting on the same set of (expensive) performance tyres it came with - with only minimal wear. And I've made some decent use of the Loud Pedal, but all perfectly legal, officer.<br ><br >A full spectrum of seasonal driving has revealed some of its downsides though. It only really has two states of being: switched off or absolutely berserk. On smooth, curving roads its general manners and ability to surgical slice through apexes is genuinely breath-taking - a particular highlight being one particularly cocky Focus ST owner, flashing their lights for a race on the daily commute home, left for dust whenever we hit the twisty stuff. When the conditions are right and the surface decent, it's easily the most rapid cross-country drive I've ever had.<br ><br >Reflecting on when I was researching the Abarth last summer, I think Autocar captured its character best: \"bumper-car compactness and manoeuvrability, brusque handling, and the fierce yet patchy acceleration of a terrier gathering speed on wet grass.\" But one thing I don't love is the punishingly hard ride for a \"daily.\" Try to push it too far on our more typical bombed-out British B-roads, and you risk being chucked through the nearest hedge and coming to rest coughing up a vertebrae or three. It's an utter savage through and through.<br ><br >Still, it is consistently brilliant fun, and I'm also quite fond of its Marmite nature with other motorists; from angry boot-hangers, thinking it's \"just a noisy 500\" - before binning them with a quick drop-shift into second gear and a stomp on the accelerator - to boy racers' jaws hanging open when they hear the frankly rude 'Record Monza' exhaust system detonate into life. That thunderous burble is likely as close as I'll ever get to owning a V8, and I'm okay with that.<br ><br >All said and done, its proud unhingedness still makes me grin like a loon when I walk back to it at the petrol station. Just like this first photo I ever took of it, about 20 minutes after collection in late 2020."

    description: "December seemed mostly bright and dry, a completely un-pathetic fallacy. A lot of folks I know were under heavy clouds, simply exhausted, or navigating a lot of uncertainty. The bright end to these dark tunnels can feel like a long way off. I hope and pray that those we know who are struggling will keep their eyes keen for signs of light and hold on to the proverbial railings as they find their way."

What a wonderful witness in this politically correct day and age when the words ‘Christmas time’ are replaced by ‘time of festivities' and persecution of Christians is rife throughout the world. This is for those poor people who are so courageous and remain strong in faith regardless... Hope you’ve all had a good Christmas!"
    alt: "An amazing show of Christian faith - a house covered in white lights, which isn’t that unusual at this time of year, but next to the house on the drive was erected a lifesize depiction of the Nativity Scene complete with animals, all lit up and standing in an open tent. A really encouraging sight in this politically correct day and age where the word Christmas is replaced by time of Festivity! This is for those brave souls throughout the world persecuted for their faith! Hope you’ve had a good Christmas!"

Right: Kitty Kitty's Kitty's Kitty. Which must be said in full at all times."

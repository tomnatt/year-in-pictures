The Snowdrops are here, but also Daffodil bulbs are sprouting forth, with some hints from the Tulips just poking through the soil, and here and there some germinated seeds of various coloured Poppies are giving promise of a colourful ride through to summer. But the leftovers of winter are still evident elsewhere in the garden, with lots of branches broken by the weight of snow now waiting to be cut back and cleared away to the refuse tip. A garden never sleeps..."

The one behind the motley crew is imaginatively called Steel Bridge because .... well you can probably work out why! Built in 1905 it carries local trams, trains, vehicles and pedestrians. The middle section rises between the towers to allow shipping to pass through. Overall, it's quite a bit of Meccano."

Athens is pretty much surrounded by mountains!).  It really gives you a feel for the huge size of the capital, although admittedly only a fraction of the size of London (just for perspective).  Anyways, I love a good vantage point, especially if it involves a mountain.  Extra bonus if there are more than one!  :D"

They can stay under water for so long you assume they've surfaced elsewhere and stop looking, then it pops up right next to you with a fish in it's beak."

So how do you write down music without actually writing down music?  Squiggles.

    description: "This little stretch of water was not so long ago a raging torrent, as it formed a narrow channel in and out of Pagham Harbour. The shore was eroding fast and to protect the seafront houses, big boulders were put in place; but nature had a better plan. One stormy night the power of the sea opened up the spit and the water started to flow straight out of the harbour into the sea. Gradually the old channel got blocked off and the seafront houses have now a lagoon in front of them and the sea in the distance."

    description: "During our holiday in the Algarve we went on a boat trip to see this amazing sea cave and some beautiful rock formations along the coast near Lagoa in the western Algarve. The boat takes you right into the cave, where you can see the blue sky through an opening in the ceiling called the eye. You can only access this cave by boat, swimming or looking through the eye from above."

    description: "I found this lovely restful seating area under a pergola graced with Hops in a peaceful garden at Manor House Farm, North Tiverton in Devon, whilst on a retreat recently. They were so attractive and a refreshing green hanging there; I could almost smell beer! Most people on the retreat didn’t even seem to notice their beauty and just walked by. I was thankful I had found this inviting and relaxing space."

    description: "This month we tackled an escape room in Kings Cross called The Penitentiary. Three of us hadn't done one before, and the other one was limping heavily but despite this (and a slow start) we escaped with around seven and a half minutes to spare. We escaped a pair of cells, decoded a hidden code and disabled a laser trap before wiring up a generator and powering a hidden door to freedom. There are another three to do. We intend to conquer all three.<br ><br >Fun fact - all the people in this picture are involved in this site.<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/43206154210\">Flickr</a>."

This kid was having so much fun on the Cloud Bridge in the Biosphere we couldn’t resist a photo. He reminded us of our two sons who danced similarly on a bench in Switzerland at the same age. Lovely place to visit."

By complete contrast, for the scientists out there, the House contains the room where Joseph Priestley discovered \"dephlogisticated air\" (ie. oxygen) plus many other gases for the first time."

The first couple are a relatively short walk from the centre of town, but to reach the further extremes of the solar system, you may need to catch a bus.<br ><br >During our trip we found Mercury (smaller than a pea), Venus (about the size of a ball bearing), Earth (near a record shop and not much bigger), Mars (tiny, but attached to a cafe that did very nice brownies) and Uranus (about the size of a ping-pong ball and attached to a nondescript shed miles out of town).

Definitely my favourite room in the house."

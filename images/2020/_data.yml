Every year we visit a wonderful nature reserve near Naples, Florida called Corkscrew Sanctuary.  Sometimes you see lots of birds and sometimes you don't.  This year Richard managed to photograph both a male (multi coloured) and a female (green) Painted Bunting.  It makes us smile just thinking about it.  We were lucky.  Take care and stay healthy."

Early in May my Google Fit came up with a random number for my remaining move minutes. Initially the number reminded me  of some kind of spooky film where some kind of technology may show you a countdown until your death. Some quick calculations later it works out as just under 620 years so if it is a death clock, it's predicting my being turned into a vampire..."

We had friends over for drinks one hot afternoon and our son just spent a week with us working from Richard’s office. We had a walk with Tom’s parents to Coopers Hill (cheese rolling hill) and we were advised that our holiday to Lundy Island is still happening. So you would think, in retrospect, we should be smiling!  However, we along with many others we have spoken to lately,  have been feeling rather blue and weary and fed up.  Life has become monotonous and this feeling of constraint is wearing very thin. So, in short, not a joyful time in the Green household presently and a good laugh was needed. We found this card unexpectedly in the card box and it made us laugh right out loud so took a photo and emailed to everyone we know!  We hope it makes you smile at the very least.\r\n PS. It’s an Anniversary Card just in case you didn’t know..."

There were so many photos to choose from.  These ponies were just beautiful. The Lundy ponies are a mix of New Forest ponies and a Welsh Mountain roan stallion introduced to the island in 1928. We also saw Sika deer, wild goats, cattle, sheep, seals and puffins!!!!  We managed 15 Letter Boxes and hope to do the rest except for the one we will never be able to find on Rat Island next summer.  We walked 40 miles on this short break in 5 days. Took a week to recover. Hope you are all well."

We don’t know the little boy and probably shouldn’t have taken his photo but he was obviously enjoying his run down the rows of flowers. It was difficult to capture the scale of the planting. It was quite a beautiful sight to behold especially when we are still quite restricted going places. We bought some sunflowers and two bags of confetti for our nephew’s wedding hopefully in May. It was suppose to happen this past August. Hope you are all doing well and getting out a bit more."

    description: "I visited my parents this month and we had a great time. We went on a sponsored walk which was great, although social distancing made it a bit strange as people caught each other up at stiles and there was a concertina effect with everyone trying to stay appropriately away.<br ><br >I took <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/albums/72157715959520093\">a load of photos</a>. This was one of the more technical ones - I was playing with shapes (and black and white) and I'm quite pleased with how the details came out.<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/50339222872/\">Flickr</a>."

    caption: "The Tenor Bell"
    description: "Recently I was asked to talk to the local Mothers Union about bell-ringing and took some photos inside the belfry at Minchinhampton church for the presentation. This photo is of the tenor bell which was cast in 1825 and is the heaviest bell there at approx 600kg. Notice the large wheel with the bell-rope attached; this allows the bell to be swung through 360 degrees and controlled in timing to within 0.05 seconds, despite its weight and turning momentum. This is unique to English-style bellringing, prevalent mainly in the UK plus a few towers in Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada and South Africa."

    description: "This is a statue of a devil hidden in the Quadrant Shopping Centre in Swansea - definitely not the sort of thing you expect to see in an upstairs window of a high-street arcade, next-door to New Look.<br ><br >In the 1890s, St Mary's Church in Swansea was due to be rebuilt and the job of designing the new building was put out to tender. One of the architects who was not selected felt particularly slighted. So slighted, in fact, that he bought the plot of land opposite, built a set of offices on it and in the window facing the church he placed a statue of a devil and said \"When your church is destroyed and burnt to the ground, my devil will remain laughing\". <br ><br >In February 1941, St. Mary's Church was destroyed in the blitz - and the laughing devil survived.<br ><br >In the 1950s and 60s the church was rebuilt, the office block was torn down and the devil went into hiding. By the 1980s the site was now a shopping centre and when the Old Nick statue was rediscovered (by now hiding in a garage in Gloucester) they decided, after some controversy, to place him back in an upstairs window.<br ><br >Every time I'm in Swansea and on this street I try and get a photo of him, but it's quite tricky. The awning of the shopping centre and the glare of the window make it particularly difficult. Also, and perhaps deliberately, he's not really in direct line-of-site with the church any more. The corner of the building would surely obstruct his view - and his current position means he's now looking up the street that runs alongside the church, rather than directly at it.<br ><br >What I'm saying is, if I were the Primark, I'd be worried."

First constructed in earth and wood and later rebuilt  in the 13th century in stone in the half-moon Norman way with double outer walls and a deep moat. It looks fairly intact however can’t be sure as we didn’t have time to explore it. Worth a second visit though..."

We went on Easter morning - it was warm and sunny and there were many new sculptures to marvel at.  This one is at the entrance and has been there about 2 years now.  There are a lot of very quirky sculptures which we loved.  Many are for sale.  We rather doubt this one is though.  We bought 3 beautiful glass foxglove mosaics which are now standing proudly in our small woodland garden along with the beautiful blue and white bells."

It is part of a coastal defence system hastily constructed in spring 1940 that stretches from Sheringham to Cley (Cley will be familiar to the bird watchers amongst us!). These defences are I believe of historic national importance but are being allowed to be washed into the sea without any attempts to preserve them. What a contrast to the occupied islands of Jersey and Guernsey that have conscientiously preserved the defences of their WW2 occupier so we can understand the impact of recent history."

    description: "\"The lake at Stourhead is artificially created. Following a path around the lake is meant to evoke a journey similar to that of Aeneas's descent in to the underworld. In addition to Greek mythology, the layout is evocative of the 'genius of the place,' a concept expounded by Alexander Pope. Buildings and monuments are erected in remembrance of family and local history. Henry Hoare was a collector of art; one of his pieces was Claude Lorrain's Aeneas at Delos, which is thought to have inspired the pictorial design of the gardens. Passages telling of Aeneas's journey are quoted in the temples surrounding the lake.\" [Wikipedia, May 2019]"

    description: "One memory that will stick in my mind from June is the two weeks I spent creating space for students to de-stress up at Bath Spa University. In particular, the time we had with a number of drama students who were right in the thick of performances. Originally bumping into them as they practiced Shakespeare around the grounds (which was moving to the point of goosebumps), we invited a group of about fifteen along. An hour later two turned up, smiled politely, made some mocktails, played a bit of frisbee and then slipped away. An hour later they returned with two more, who then became fixated on the rather challenging thousand-piece jigsaw and were most concerned that the same puzzle would be there when they returned later. Later that day, a larger crowd of drama students turned up. Over the course of those few days, those fifteen students chose to make the space their home... and the puzzle theirs to conquer."

Why would anyone produce a sculpture of a question mark? But then there were also loads of others that made some sense and really stretched the imagination.

I think this was my favourite moment. There is something special about walking behind a waterfall, and especially when you're underground. The path here actually leads behind then between two cascades of water, accompanied by an incredible roaring noise.<br ><br >It is possible to get married in this cave. I'd imagine that is spectacular, although bridal dresses aren't usually known for their waterproof characteristics.<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/49001721203\">Flickr</a>."

It has existed since the 13th century but was developed into its current form in the early 19th century by installing lock gates on a tidal stretch of the River Avon in the centre of the city and providing a tidal by-pass for the river. It is often called the Floating Harbour as the water level remains constant and it is not affected by the state of the tide on the river.\" Wikipedia (Nov '19)<br ><br >On the right of the picture, you can see the Cheese Lane Shot Tower:<br ><br >\"The original tower was built in 1782, in the Bristol suburb of Redcliffe, by William Watts, who is credited with the invention of the tower process for the manufacture of lead shot. It was the progenitor of many similar towers built around the world, and survived various changes of ownership until it was taken over by the Sheldon Bush and Patent Shot Company Limited in 1868. It continued in use under their ownership until 1968, when it was demolished as part of a road widening scheme.\" Wikipedia (Nov '19)"

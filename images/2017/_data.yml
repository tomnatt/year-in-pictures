    description: "An incredible experience walking with a pack of three Arctic Wolves at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust in Beenham, courtesy of Ed and Shelley. They kept us under close control as we went around a field and it was very easy to forget they weren't dogs until they stood next to a person and we saw how big they are. A wolf has the IQ of a five year old human and the ability to learn via observation. They keep trying to work out how to escape from their enclosures although it seems to be more because they can than because they want to.<br ><br >Only disappointment of the day lay in my photography equipment. I felt the limitations of my phone camera for the first time when looking back at <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/sets/72157679727701615\">my photographs</a>. This is one of the better pictures, although it was taken at the enclosure rather than on the walk, hence the annoying fencing.

The original idea was that they would be mass-produced and used as chalets or holiday homes - however the rise in the cost of oil (and therefore plastic) in the 1970s meant that fewer than 100 were ever made. There are thought to be 60 still in existence, one of which is currently sitting on the roof of Central Saint Martins in King's Cross. It was rescued and restored by the artist Craig Barnes and once a month he opens it up, lets people inside and talks them through the lengths he went to to save the house. There's more information, with photos of the building in various stages of dilapidation and renovation, on <a href=\"http://www.futurohouse.co.uk/\">the house website</a>."

The village pub was purchased on a similar basis 4 year's ago. The retiring shop owners had 3 days off in 47 years! One to collect an OBE for services to the village, 1 when a relative died, and the other when they were just too ill to serve! Tesco is quaking in its boots at the competition we're now threatening!"

Inside, one of the pillars has a hole in it, and it is apparently good luck to squeeze yourself through this gap - meaning this particular incarnation's demise will almost certainly be due to a pillar finally giving-way after the hole has been slowly eroded by the constant stream of school trips.

Originally used as storerooms, field shelters and peasants' dwellings they were constructed without mortar for quick dismantling to avoid tax! Now highly sought after for use as shops, restaurants and rental properties. To immerse ourselves in the experience we rented a rural trullo as our holiday home."

He joined up very late on in the war (as soon as he was 17) but served in Northern Ireland then in Palestine as part of the peace keeping force. I'd never really heard much about his exploits back then so was quite touched when he showed me these links to part of his past pre-children!"

It was an evening of extreme contrasts - the lights of the fire and fireworks against the black of night, the bangs of the fireworks against the soft cooing of appreciation from the villagers.<br ><br >I still love a good bonfire today, although they are harder to come by than fireworks.<br ><br >This year I took along my camera and attempted to apply all that I learned last month to get some good pictures. I think this one is my favourite, but you can judge for yourself if you like - my other pictures are in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/albums/72157662314917278\">an album on Flickr</a> and I wrote <a href=\"http://tomnatt.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/remember-remember.html\">a blog post about my thinking for the pictures</a>.<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/38142269986/\">Flickr</a>."

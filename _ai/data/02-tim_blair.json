  "description": "The image captures a man wearing a flat cap and a blue jacket, with a playful expression, as a colorful parrot perches on his head. In the background, a wooden structure and another parrot on a branch can be seen, along with a blurred figure of a woman wearing a raincoat. The setting appears to be an aviary or a similar environment where birds are kept.",

  "poem": "There once was a man with a hat,\nWho found where the parrots were at.\nOne perched on his crown,\nWith feathers so brown,\nIn a moment both quirky and pat."
